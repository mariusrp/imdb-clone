        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Marius, and I am a 19-year-old aspiring developer who is passionate about using React and Next JS to create immersive web experiences. I created this website as a clone of IMDb, one of my favorite platforms for discovering new movies and TV shows.</p>
        <p>As a lifelong movie buff, I wanted to create a space where fellow enthusiasts could come together to discuss their favorite films, actors, and directors. Whether youre looking for in-depth reviews, behind-the-scenes trivia, or just a place to connect with other fans, I hope youll find what youre looking for here.</p> 
        <p> In addition to my work on this website, Im always looking for new opportunities to expand my skills and grow as a developer. When Im not coding, you can find me reading up on the latest tech trends, trying out new recipes in the kitchen, or catching up on my favorite shows.</p> 
        <p>Thank you for visiting my site, and I look forward to sharing my passion for movies and technology with you!</p>
